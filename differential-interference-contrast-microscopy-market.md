<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Upright Microscope</li><li>Inverted Microscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy is categorized into two main types: upright microscopes and inverted microscopes. Upright microscopes feature a configuration where the light source and objective lens are positioned above the specimen, ideal for examining thin biological samples. Inverted microscopes, on the other hand, have their light source below the specimen, allowing for observation of larger or heavier samples, such as cell cultures in flasks. Both types enhance contrast and provide detailed imaging of transparent samples without staining.</p></p>
