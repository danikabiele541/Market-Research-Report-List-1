<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuro Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Neuro-stimulators</li><li>Non-invasive Neuro-stimulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neurostimulator market is divided into invasive and non-invasive types. Invasive neurostimulators involve surgical implantation, delivering targeted electrical impulses directly to neural structures, commonly used for chronic pain management and movement disorders. Non-invasive neurostimulators, on the other hand, apply external stimuli through methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, providing therapeutic effects without surgery. Both types aim to modulate nerve activity, offering varied applications in treating neurological and psychiatric conditions.</p></p>
