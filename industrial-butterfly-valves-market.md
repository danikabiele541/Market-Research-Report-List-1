<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Butterfly Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentric Butterfly Valves</li><li>Doubly-eccentric Butterfly Valves</li><li>Triply-eccentric Butterfly Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial butterfly valves market is characterized by three main types: concentric, doubly-eccentric, and triply-eccentric butterfly valves. Concentric butterfly valves feature a central disc aligned with the valve body, ideal for low-pressure applications. Doubly-eccentric valves have a disc that is offset from the center, reducing wear and allowing for better sealing at higher pressures. Triply-eccentric valves incorporate a third offset for enhanced sealing and minimal friction, making them suitable for high-temperature and high-pressure environments. Each type serves distinct operational needs across various industries.</p></p>
